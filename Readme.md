# Gamefied Education Platform

A gamified education platform designed for schools and colleges — bringing learning to life through missions, leaderboards, and interactive lessons.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This frontend-only prototype implements a gamified learning experience with:

- **Landing page**: Entry point for users.  
- **Login**: Simple authentication screen.  
- **Missions**: Tasks or challenges students complete to learn.  
- **Lessons**: Educational content (e-lessons) integrated with gamified flow.  
- **Leaderboard**: Displays top performers to encourage healthy competition.  
- **Profile Page**: Student profile showing progress, completed missions, and achievements.

## 📁 Repository Structure

/
├─ index.html
├─ landing.html
├─ login.html
├─ missions.html
├─ ecolessons.html
├─ leaderboard.html
└─ profilePage.html

- **index.html**: Main entry page or home.  
- **landing.html**: Welcome / marketing page.  
- **login.html**: Sign-in interface for users.  
- **missions.html**: Lists gamified missions or challenges.  
- **ecolessons.html**: Educational lesson content.  
- **leaderboard.html**: Shows the ranking of users.  
- **profilePage.html**: Student dashboard/profile with stats.

There is also a **landing.jpg** — likely used on the landing page for design / branding.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML**: All pages are built purely in HTML.  
- **CSS / JS**: (Assumed) present in inline or linked files, but not part of repository structure — you can expand this in the future.

## ✅ Key Features

- **Gamification**: Missions + Leaderboard to motivate students.  
- **Modular Content**: Separate pages for lessons, missions, and profile.  
- **User Progress**: Profile page to track how far a student has come.

## 📥 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository  

	   ```bash

			git clone https://github.com/Aryan736/FrontEnd-Project.git

Open any .html file in your browser (e.g., index.html)

(Optional) Use a local server (like VS Code Live Server) to simulate navigation between pages

## 🎯 Future Improvements

Here are potential next steps to evolve this prototype into a full-fledged platform:

- Add authentication backend (e.g., Firebase / Node.js)

- Implement persistent user data (missions completed, scores)

- Integrate rich content for lessons (videos, quizzes)

- Enhance layout with responsive design

- Add animations / micro-interactions to improve engagement

- Build admin panel to add new missions, leaderboard management
